# Hi, I'm Kap 👋

I’m an early-career cybersecurity professional who loves getting hands-on with security work, from lab projects to real-world IT security tasks. Through my part-time role and internship at Global Green Tag International, I’ve supported phishing simulation campaigns, conducted web application testing, updated incident response plans, reviewed cybersecurity policies, and delivered staff awareness sessions. I’ve also identified risks and vulnerabilities, coordinated mitigation strategies, and maintained technical documentation to help improve overall security posture.

On the tech side, I’ve built and explored labs and projects including Active Directory environments, monitoring logs in Splunk, experimenting with Azure IAM, running SOAR and EDR workflows, and performing digital investigations using tools like Autopsy, Wireshark, and Volatility.

I enjoy learning by doing, figuring out how to make systems more secure, and thinking about both the technical side and how it affects people and business. Outside of cybersecurity, I love playing football and enjoy team sports that challenge me both physically and mentally.

## 💻 What I Do

Through my internship and part-time roles at Global Green Tag International, I’ve:

- Supported phishing simulation campaigns to improve staff awareness and reduce social engineering risk  
- Reviewed and enhanced cybersecurity policies and standards aligned with ISO 27001 and the Essential Eight  
- Identified and coordinated mitigation of security risks and vulnerabilities  
- Contributed to incident response documentation and reusable IR templates  
- Developed and delivered cybersecurity awareness content for staff

In addition, I’ve built and tested enterprise-style lab environments, including:

- **Active Directory deployments** for secure identity and access management  
- **Splunk SOC labs** for log monitoring and incident detection  
- **Microsoft Entra / Azure IAM labs** for cloud identity & access management  
- **SOAR & EDR workflows** for automated detection and response  
- **Digital investigation labs** using Autopsy, Wireshark, Volatility, and other DFIR tools
