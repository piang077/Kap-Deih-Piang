# Hi, I'm Kap 👋

I’m an early-career cybersecurity professional who loves getting hands-on with security work, from lab projects to real-world IT security tasks. Through my part-time role and internship, I’ve supported phishing simulation campaigns, conducted web application testing, updated incident response plans, reviewed cybersecurity policies, and delivered staff awareness sessions. I’ve also identified risks and vulnerabilities, coordinated mitigation strategies, and maintained technical documentation to help improve overall security posture.

On the tech side, I’ve built and explored labs and projects including Active Directory environments, monitoring logs in Splunk, experimenting with Azure IAM, running SOAR and EDR workflows, and performing digital investigations using tools like Autopsy, Wireshark, Sleuth Kit, and Volatility.

I enjoy learning by doing, figuring out how to make systems more secure, and thinking about both the technical side and how it affects people and business. Outside of cybersecurity, I love playing football and enjoy team sports that challenge me both physically and mentally.

## 💻 What I Do

Through my internship and part-time roles at Global Green Tag International, I’ve:

- Supported phishing simulation campaigns to improve staff awareness and reduce social engineering risk  
- Reviewed and enhanced cybersecurity policies and standards aligned with ISO 27001 and the Essential Eight  
- Contributed to incident response documentation and reusable IR templates  
- Developed and delivered cybersecurity awareness content for staff
- Identified and raised risks or vulnerabilities, coordinating mitigation strategies with senior management
- Maintained technical documentation to support security and IT operations.


In addition, I’ve built and tested enterprise-style lab environments, including:

- **Active Directory deployments** for secure identity and access management  
- **Microsoft Entra / Azure IAM labs** for cloud identity & access management  
- **SOAR & EDR workflows** for automated detection and response  
- **Digital Investigation Lab** using Autopsy, Wireshark, Volatility, and other DFIR tools
  - [View project](https://github.com/piang077/Digital-Investigation-Simulated-Case-)
- **Splunk SOC Lab** for log monitoring and incident detection
